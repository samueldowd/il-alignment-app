Epic,IL-1000,Improve Teacher Login Experience,"Background
Teachers report frequent friction during sign‑in: low‑contrast labels, unclear errors, and inconsistent behavior on mobile devices. Help desk tickets cite forgotten passwords, lockouts after failed attempts, and confusion about which account to use. This epic addresses those problems end‑to‑end to make login fast, forgiving, and inclusive.

What needs to be done
We will redesign the login flow with clear labels and input states, add a password visibility toggle, provide better validation and guidance, improve error messages, add caps‑lock detection, clarify session options, and harden the “forgot password” flow with intuitive copy. Rate limiting and lockout rules will be tuned and communicated clearly. We will also add resilient loading states and prevent accidental double‑submissions.

Why it needs to be done
Friction at login blocks class time and generates support volume. A simpler login cuts failure loops and reduces average time-to-first-action. The work unlocks downstream flows (roster sync, assessments) by getting teachers reliably into the product.

Acceptance criteria
• Teachers can complete sign‑in without confusion from common error cases (bad password, invalid email, caps lock on, network error).
• Helpful, plain‑language error messages with steps to resolve are shown inline and in banners where appropriate.
• Inputs validate early (email format) and guide users before submission.
• Buttons indicate loading state and block duplicate submissions.
• Password toggle is present and accessible via keyboard/tap.
• Lockouts are communicated with time remaining and next steps.
• “Forgot password” is discoverable and results in a clear success message and guidance if no account is found.

Success KPI
A critical KPI is a measurable reduction in customer support tickets related to teacher sign‑in after release (target −40% within 60 days). Secondary signals include improved first‑attempt success rate and reduced time to sign‑in.",In Progress,Avery Chen,Avery Chen,55,High,"login,teacher,ux","Auth,Frontend,Design",Product Team,2025-10-01,2025-11-15,2025-10-05,2026-01-15,,,2025.4,
